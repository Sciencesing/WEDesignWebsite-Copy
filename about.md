# HEY THERE!
Welcome to our website! It is so nice to have you here.

WE Design is a University of Manitoba, student-operated organization comprised of undergraduate and graduate students from mechanical, civil, electrical, computer, and biosystems engineering. We aim to promote green energy, by providing an opportunity for our students to develop professional skills in the designing, manufacturing, and project management of our small-scale wind turbine. 

After successfully completing our second prototype, we took it to the Hanze University of Applied Sciences in Groningen, Netherlands, for the International Small Wind Turbine Contest (ISWTC) in July 2019. Being the only North American team to compete on this international stage, we seek to continually improve our design and hone our skills for a better team and for a better world.
