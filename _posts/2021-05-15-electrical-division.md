Our electrical division has the opportunity for hands-on experience using industry loading software such as Altrium. They design, build and test a number of the behind the scenes components that make our wind turbines work, such as PCB and power generations. New members can join in and learn how to design a control system, how to use a PI Controller, as well as the micro-controller programming on Python and C++.

A wind turbine's electrical components usually reside within the nacelle, the body of the wind turbine.

### Design and simulation projects

* Redesign the Rectifier Controller.

* Optimize the Boost Controller component values and frequency.

* Reduce heat losses of the power traces on the PCB.

### Software projects

* Control System Software â€“ interfacing the control board with all sensors and actuators, monitor data. This will likely be done in Python, but may also be done in another language like C or C++.

* Implement a passive control algorithm.

### Wind Turbine Simulator

* Develop a graphical simulation to model dynamic behaviour of a wind turbine.   

### Possible Hardware Projects

* Complete the current power board.             
  
* Iterate improvements on the current hardware.
