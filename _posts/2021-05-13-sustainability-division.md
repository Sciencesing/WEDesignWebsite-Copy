Our sustainability division is responsible for writing and compiling the sustainability report for our WE Design team. This sustainability report is worth 30% of our final mark at the ISWTC and a core part of the deals at WE Design. The sustainability division may also influence the more technical aspects of the design in order to aim for greener and cleaner energy.
