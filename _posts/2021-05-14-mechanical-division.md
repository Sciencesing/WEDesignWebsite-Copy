Our mechanical division works on most of the physical structures of the wind turbine. 

Some of these projects include the pitch mechanism, drivetrain, brake system, and composite layup projects. Designing the components with the help of SolidWorks and Q-Blade.

Working together, we learn to design, and problem solve with the help of research, previous year's models and lots trial and error.
