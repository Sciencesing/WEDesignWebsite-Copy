Our mechanical division works on most of the physical structures of the wind turbine. 

Some of these projects include the pitch mechanism, drivetrain, brake system, and composite layup projects. We design the components with the help of SolidWorks and Q-Blade.

Working together, we learn to design, and problem solve with the help of research, previous year's models and lots trial and error.





*Drivetrain - The mechanical system that connects the rotor system to the power generation.*  

### Current Drivetrain Projects

* Complete the redesign of gearbox.

* Complete the redesign of emergency brake system.

* Design the compact system.

* Design sustainable manufacturing.

*Rotor System - The system that converts wind energy into mechanical energy (torque, etc.).*  
*Pitch Mechanism - *  

### Current Rotor System Projects

* Improve weather resistance of pitch mechanism.
* Improve sustainaility of manufacturing of pitch mechanism.
* Lighten design of pitch mechanism.

*Frame - The exterior shell of the wind turbine.*  
*Tower - The structure of the wind turbine.*  
*Nacelle - *  

### Current Frame and Tower Projects

* Design a new, lighter display tower.
* Design a new nacelle that completely encloses internal mechanisms and systems.
* Improve weather resistance of nacelle.
