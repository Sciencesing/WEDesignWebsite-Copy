# HEY THERE!
Welcome to our website! It is so nice to have you here.

WE Design is a University of Manitoba, student-operated organization comprised of undergraduate and graduate students from mechanical, civil, electrical, computer, and biosystems engineering. We aim to promote green energy, by providing an opportunity for our students to develop professional skills in the designing, manufacturing, and project management of our small-scale wind turbine.

After successfully completing our second prototype, we took it to the Hanze University of Applied Sciences in Groningen, Netherlands, for the International Small Wind Turbine Contest (ISWTC) in July 2019. Being the only North American team to compete on this international stage, we seek to continually improve our design and hone our skills for a better team and for a better world.


#### This year, 
our team will operate both on and off campus according to UofM COVID Guidelines in the Fall/Winter terms. 
We are currently in Year 2 of our 2-Year design process and starting September 1st have permission to return to shop with 60% normal capacity to begin our build cycle. This year, we will continue to focus on education and building a solid knowledge base for our new members. 

We will be competing in summer of 2022 International Small Wind Turbine Competition (ISWTC) with our new turbine prototype. We will be holding work sessions and tutorials on design, use of CAD software, composite manufacturing practices, and whatever else our members are interested in!



### FUN FACT
--------------------------------

#### WE Design stands for Wind Energy Design, which *we* design! Get it?!
